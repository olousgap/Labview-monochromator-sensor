Labview drivers for Spectral Products CM110 monochromator and 1830-C or 841-P-USB sensors

The software was used for total power measurements at the end of optical fibres with a thermal detector (Thorlabs, S302C) and for spectral characterisation with a Czerny–Turner monochromator with f = 110 mm (Spectral Products, CM110) and calibrated silicon and germanium photodiodes (Newport, 818-UV and 818-IR, respectively).
